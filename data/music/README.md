# MUSIC

SBK is a RIFF container format, just like WAV. The original soundfont can only be partly opened in ModPlug due to compatibility issues with the old format.
Srtuss converted the file to WAV.

The original music.dat contains 20 songs in XMI format. 
Srtuss extracted and converted them to midi.
